// Time Complexity : log(min(m,n))
// Reason: We are applying binary search in the array with minimum size among the two. And we know the time complexity of the binary search is 
// log(N) where N is the size of the array. Thus, the time complexity of this approach is log(min(m,n)), where m,n are the sizes of two arrays.

// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Reason: Since no extra data structure is used, making space complexity to O(1).

Yes, shifting a bit number one place to the right results in halving that number in decimal. This is because shifting a binary number one place to the right is equivalent to dividing the number by 2 in decimal.

In binary arithmetic, shifting a number to the right by one position effectively divides it by 2. Here's why:

Each bit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from 
2
0
2 
0
  (least significant bit) to higher powers as you move left.
Shifting all bits to the right by one position moves each bit one place lower, effectively dividing the entire number by 2.
For example, let's take the binary number 
110
1
2
1101 
2

 :

Shifting 
110
1
2
1101 
2

  to the right by one position gives 
011
0
2
0110 
2

 .
In decimal, 
110
1
2
=
13
1101 
2

 =13 and 
011
0
2
=
6
0110 
2

 =6.
13
รท
2
=
6.5
13รท2=6.5, confirming that shifting 
110
1
2
1101 
2

  right by one position indeed results in halving the decimal value.
Therefore, shifting a bit number one place to the right results in half of that number in decimal.
