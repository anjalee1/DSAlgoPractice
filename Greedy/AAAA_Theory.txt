Greedy Method: This method is used to solve optimization problem.
Optimization Problem: A problem which demands either minimum result or maximum result.
Feasible solution: A solution which satisfies some constraints.
Optimal solution: A solution which is satisfying the objective of a problem

•	Greedy method says that a problem should be solved in stages.
•	In each stage we will consider input from a given problem and if that input is feasible then we will include in the solution, so by including all those feasible solutions we will get an optimal solution.
•	When we follow known methods of solving a problem and we quickly solve it, that approach is called greedy.
