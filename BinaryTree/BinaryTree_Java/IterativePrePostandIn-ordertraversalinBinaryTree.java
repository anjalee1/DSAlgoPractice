//Time Complexity: O(N)
//Reason: We are visiting every node thrice therefore time complexity will be O(3*N), which can be assumed as linear time complexity
//Space Complexity: O(N)
//Reason: We are using three lists and a stack to store the nodes. The time complexity will be about O(4*N), which can be assumed as linear time complexity.
