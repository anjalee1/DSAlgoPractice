//Time Complexity: 

    //The average and best-case running time of the Rabin-Karp algorithm is O(n+m), but its worst-case time is O(nm).
    //The worst case of the Rabin-Karp algorithm occurs when all characters of pattern and text are the same as the hash values of all the substrings of txt[] match with the hash value of pat[]. 

//Auxiliary Space: O(1)
